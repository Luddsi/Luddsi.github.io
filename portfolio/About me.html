      <h1>
        Hello, and welcome to my ego page! </h1>

      <p>
        My name is Ludde Erlandsson, born in -93, living and grew up in Växjö. Here I live with my partner in a
        centrally located apartment, where we thrive!
        <p>As a person, I have always been driven, solution-oriented and very social. If there is something that needs to
        be fixed or planned, I have always been comfortable taking the first step and getting that particular ball
        in motion</p>
        <p>When it comes to my work experience, I have been involved in quite a lot. Everything from the pulsating
        environment in the restaurant industry, to a Deli where we sold cheese, fish, meat, food and talked to ALOT of costumers, and to then see a small part of
        the world through a foreign mission in Africa, Mali, led by the UN and the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>

      </p>

      <p>
        As a lefthanded, I have always been creative and passionate about creating or finding creative solutions to
        problems or shortcomings that have arisen, so I applied to EC education in the summer of 2021 where I feel I have
        found the right place for me.
        I have always found it easy to learn new things as most things interest me and I am not afraid to try as
        I believe it makes you grow as a person!</p>

        <p>In my previous workplaces, I have always been given a responsible role and I feel that previous managers and
        colleagues have trusted me and my judgment, which I appreciate enormously. Former colleagues would
        describe me as a kind person who is easy to get along with and creates a good atmosphere in the team!
        I really hope I interested you and would you like to get a better picture of me I will be more than happy
        to meet in person, thank you for reading!

      </p>
